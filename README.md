# HoloJustice Balance Mod

HoloJustice Balance Mod is a rebalance of Vermintide 2 that uses [Tourney Balance](https://github.com/Camilo-Guzman/Tourney-Balance) as a basis and adds a few minor tweaks to make the game more fun for casual DWONS players instead of focusing on competitive integrity for tournaments.

It's not intended as a serious mod and Tourney Balance is still recommended over this mod for all playstyles.
