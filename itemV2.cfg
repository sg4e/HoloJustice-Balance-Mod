HoloXussy is the BETA version of HoloJustice Balance Mod, which is a rebalance of Vermintide 2 that uses [url=https://github.com/Camilo-Guzman/Tourney-Balance]Tourney Balance[/url] as a basis and adds a few minor tweaks to make the game more fun for casual DWONS players instead of focusing on competitive integrity for tournaments.

It's not intended as a serious mod and Tourney Balance is still recommended over this mod for all playstyles.
